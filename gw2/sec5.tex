%Underlying Services
%For server administration modules, what services are provided by the underlying server? Does the server provide service that facilitates authentication and/or authorization? What clients (in general and at Cal Poly Pomona) use the service?For what purposes?

ZFS provides neither authentication neither authorization, but it does verify file permissions and ACLs based on the user. Every current person at CalPoly Pomona has a share on ZFS, it's not optional, but how many people actually utilize it can be questionable. The main purpose of ZFS is storage, but can also be used as a web hosting service as outlined in section 1.
