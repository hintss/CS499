%Underlying Services
%For server administration modules, what services are provided by the underlying server? Does the server provide service that facilitates authentication and/or authorization? What clients (in general and at Cal Poly Pomona) use the service?For what purposes?

ZFS provides neither authentication nor authorization, but it does verify file permissions and ACLs based on the user. Every current person at Cal Poly Pomona has a share on ZFS, it's not optional, but how many people actually utilize it is questionable. The main purpose of ZFS is storage, but it can also be used as a web hosting service as outlined in section 1.

Though ZFS provides neither authentication nor authorization, file permissions can be set up by using either standard unix file ownership and permissions, or unix ACLs. This can be used to restrict file access (and separately, writing) to just the file's owner, the file's group, the world, or a more complicated combination of these.
