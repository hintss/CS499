%Invocation
%How is the moduleâ€™s functionality invoked? If there is an Application
%Programming Interface (API), what methods are published, and how is
%access controlled? 

ZFS is a file system and logical volume manager, therefore many of the other supporting modules used for identity management will use ZFS to modify a user or group's file system. In this case, the ZFS module does not have a direct API, instead, Identity Management uses REST calls to perform certain functions. The calls are pre-coded in a separate subroutine in the code, which gets triggered in turn by other subroutines.  

The access, in turn, is controlled by ZFS itself. Idmgmt has its own account that it uses for making system changes for which it logs into ZFS over REST before making any other REST calls.
