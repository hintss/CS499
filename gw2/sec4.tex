%What supporting Perl modules (internal and external to Identity) are used? For what purposes?

Inside of Identity Management, ZFS is managed by the Identity::ZFS and Identity::REST::ZFS modules. Identity::ZFS has a dependency on Identity, but this isn't used for anything other than logging. The two ZFS modules have several outside dependencies (Unix::Syslog, POSIX, etc), though none of them are ZFS-specific. Instead, all the manipulation of the underlying ZFS filesystem is done by calling the ZFS command-line tools directly from inside the Identity::REST::ZFS module.

Furthermore, POSIX is specifically used within ZFS to send a SIGALRM signal to check for timeout on the connection. LWP, the World-Wide Web library for Perl, is used for the same purpose. Lastly, the external module XML-Simple is used to parse the XML data.
