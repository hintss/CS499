%Identity Information
%For modules that initiate automatic or manual identity information updates, what information is automatically and/or manually updated, and what are the authoritative sources? For server administration modules, What identity information is stored in the server? In what form?

The ZFS module has several obvious variables that must be kept sane. They include the owner's user or group ID, the name of the share, the quota, and the snap quota. The share is tied to the user/group ID, i.e. the unique key. If it changes, it is automatically changed in ZFS by the identity management suite. The quota and snap quota aren't automatically changed, but they can be manually. 

The ZFS server stores just that: user/group ID, share name, quota, snap quota. Authentication when mounting the share is done either through Kerberos for NFS mounting or on Active Directory for Samba.
